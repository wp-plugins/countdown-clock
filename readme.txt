== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I cannot find the event I want =
Have a quick look in  [mycountdown.org](http://mycountdown.org "All the countdowns in the world"), and search for your event, e.g. halloween, christmas, birthday, wedding, or pregnancy. Then go to "Event Type" dropdown, choose and save your selection. Then go to countdown drop-down and find your countdown, save the selection.

= I want my own event =
Select "My Countdown" event type and save, then choose from the "list of events" drop-down, and save again. A date and text input boxes will appear for your messages.

= Can I paste the countdown onto my page on a post, rather than a sidebar =
Yes, the javascript code is available directly from  [mycountdown.org](http://mycountdown.org "All the countdowns in the world"). You must paste the javascript into the post in HTML mode.

= I cannot input my chosen message =
Some events are preset e.g. Christmas, and the dates have been preset for you. Some events are customizable e.g. Birthday. Go to "Event type" dropdown, choose "My countdown", save settings. Text boxes will appear for your event and the message on the day of the event.

Go to the Appearance->Widgets tab in your wordpress admin panel, and choose click on settings for the countdown clock, select text, border and background colors from the drop downs

= I am getting a "Fatal error: Cannot instantiate non-existent class: datetimezone" =
Version 1.2 of the plugin requires at least version 5.x of PHP. To run the plugin with PHP4 servers, design the widget directly in [mycountdown.org/getwidget](http://mycountdown.org/getwidget/), take the widget code and paste it into a Wordpress "Text" widget on the sidebar.

= Can I choose my colour? =
You can select the countdown clock to be transparent, so the countdown's background will be that of your web page

= Why do I need to choose the event type and countdown type ? =
Choosing the event type will provide the best selection of background pictures and animations

Yes, select from the timezone dropdown select the time zone in your area.

= Can I set the time of day for the event ? =
Yes, select the hour of your event

= Can I have multiple widgets on the sidebar ? =
Yes, but use the widget generator at [mycountdown.org/getwidget](http://mycountdown.org/getwidget/), then go to the widgets panel and insert the code as "Text" on your sidebar
