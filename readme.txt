== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I am getting a "Fatal error: Cannot instantiate non-existent class: datetimezone" =
Versions 1.2+ of the plugin requires at least version 5.x of PHP. To run the plugin with PHP4 servers, design the widget directly in [mycountdown.org/getwidget](http://mycountdown.org/getwidget/), take the widget code and paste it into a Wordpress "Text" widget on the sidebar. Alternatively use version 1.1 of the plugin, which does not have timezone support.

= My wordpress is older than 2.8 =
Download version 1.3 of the countdown-clock, which is compatible with 1.5 or higher

= I cannot find the event I want =
Have a quick look in  [mycountdown.org](http://mycountdown.org "All the countdowns in the world"), and search for your event, e.g. halloween, christmas, birthday, wedding, or pregnancy. Then go to "Event Type" dropdown, choose and save your selection. Then go to countdown drop-down and find your countdown, save the selection.
